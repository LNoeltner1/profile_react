                        I am a full-stack developer born and currently based in Atlanta,
                        Georgia. I am currently attending Georgia Tech's Full-Stack Flex
                        Boot Camp. I have always had a wide range of interests, from fine
                        arts to the hard sciences, and I have been lucky to get a chance to
                        explore most of them at some point in my life.
                    </p>

                        I began at university in 2011 at the University of Georgia with a
                        focus in Pre-Veterinary Medicine, which switched to Anthropology
                        after a year and switched again to Psychology with a minor in
                        Spanish and Painting after another year. I attended U.G.A. until the
                        end of my Junior year, when I decided to leave Athens to return to
                        Atlanta.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since then, I have continued to enjoy learning independently, and,
                        in my spare time, I am almost always researching whatever fascinates
                        me in that moment. I love learning about history, language, animals,
                        the arts, space, computers and technology. I am currently teaching
                        myself German after becoming mostly fluent in Spanish in college.
                        When I am not researching interesting information, you could find me
                        watching movies, playing games, playing with my dogs, or
                        painting/making something.

                        I am more than halfway through the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp,
                        and I am greatly enjoying the opportunity to strengthen my skills as
                        a developer. See my portfolio for some of my completed projects!
